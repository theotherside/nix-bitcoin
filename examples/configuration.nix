  ### BITCOIND
  # Bitcoind is enabled by default if nix-bitcoin is enabled
  #
  # You can override default settings from secure-node.nix as follows
  # services.bitcoind.prune = lib.mkForce 100000;

  ### CLIGHTNING
  # Enable this module to use clightning, a Lightning Network implementation
  # in C.
  services.clightning.enable = true;
  # Enable this option to listen for incoming lightning connections. By
  # default nix-bitcoin nodes offer outgoing connectivity.

  ### LND
  # Disable clightning and uncomment the following line in order to enable lnd,
  # a lightning implementation written in Go.
  # services.lnd.enable = assert (!config.services.clightning.enable); true;
  ## WARNING
  # If you use lnd, you should manually backup your wallet mnemonic
  # seed. This will allow you to recover on-chain funds. You can run the
  # following command after the lnd service starts:
  # nixops scp --from bitcoin-node /secrets/lnd-seed-mnemonic ./secrets/lnd-seed-mnemonic
  # You should also backup your channel state after opening new channels.
  # This will allow you to recover off-chain funds, by force-closing channels.

  ### SPARK WALLET

  # c-lightning, accessible over the web or through mobile and desktop apps.
  # Only enable this if clightning is enabled.

  ### LIQUIDD
  # Enable this module to use Liquid, a sidechain for an inter-exchange
  # settlement network linking together cryptocurrency exchanges and
  # institutions around the world. Liquid is accessed with the elements-cli
  # tool run as user operator.

  ### LIGHTNING CHARGE
  # Enable this module to use lightning-charge, a simple drop-in solution for
  # accepting lightning payments. Only enable this if clightning is enabled.

  ### NANOPOS
  # Enable this module to use nanopos, a simple Lightning point-of-sale
  # system, powered by Lightning Charge. Only enable this if clightning and
  # lightning-charge are enabled.
  # services.nanopos.enable = true;

  ### WEBINDEX
  # Enable this module to use the nix-bitcoin-webindex, a simple website
  # displaying your node information and link to nanopos store. Only enable
  # this if clightning, lightning-charge, and nanopos are enabled.
  # services.nix-bitcoin-webindex.enable = true;

  ### RECURRING-DONATIONS
  # Enable this module to send recurring donations. This is EXPERIMENTAL; it's
  # not guaranteed that payments are succeeding or that you will notice payment
  # failure. Only enable this if clightning is enabled.
  # services.recurring-donations.enable = true;
  # Specify the receivers of the donations. By default donations are every
  # Monday at a randomized time. Check `journalctl -eu recurring-donations` or
  # `lightning-cli listpayments` for successful lightning donations.

  ### Hardware wallets
  # Enable this module to allow using hardware wallets. See https://github.com/bitcoin-core/HWI
  # for more information. Only enable this if electrs is disabled.
  # Ledger must be initialized through the official ledger live app and the Bitcoin app must
  # be installed and running on the device.

  # Trezor can be initialized with the trezorctl command in nix-bitcoin. More information in
  # `docs/usage.md`.

  # user namespaces to enable sanboxed builds and services.
